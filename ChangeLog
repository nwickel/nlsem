    from parameter estimates
  * qml(): works with non-centeres exogenous variables now; fixed bug,
    max.iter does what it is supposed to do now

Changes in 0.3

  * New function: qml(), estimate single-class model with QML as an
    alternative to LMS
  * specify_sem(): model with num.classes = 1 will be of class
    'singleClass' now instead of 'lms'
  * Data set: jordan, PISA 2006 jordan sample
  * em(): Changed logger output for NSEMM models so readability is higher;
    added max.lms = 1 so EM for single groups will only iterate once

    psi can be set to a fixed value now; changed default constraints
